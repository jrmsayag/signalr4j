[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.signalr4j/signalr4j/badge.svg?style=plastic)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.signalr4j/signalr4j)

This is a fork of the original Microsoft SignalR library and also includes fixes from various developers since 2015.  It has been renamed to signalr4j to allow publishing to maven central under the com.github.signalr4j package.

**Note: This library is [NOT compatible](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/issues/883#issuecomment-336499189) with ASP.NET Core SignalR 2.0.**

ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

## What can it be used for?
Pushing data from the server to the client (not just browser clients) has always been a tough problem. SignalR makes 
it dead easy and handles all the heavy lifting for you.

This library can be used from both regular Java or Android applications.
